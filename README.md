## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I have coded the HTML/CSS part first, then I implemented Vue3 with the composition API. I used Pinia for the values store that going through the app.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vue framework
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For some helpfull utility classes

### What I learned

I learned a lot in this challenge, I really did a step behind in JS developpment. Especially with Vue.


### Continued development

I can't wait to do another challenge with Vue3 ! I really love this tool, and everytime I writ a single line of JS, I'm improving myself.
